# Yet another yet another stm32 bootloader.

Work in progress.
**Proof of concept.**

STM32F1x series microcontrollers are the only *hopefully* supported now (will ever be supported).

1. Absolute minimum of something that could be called bootloader, not even usable now.
2. Zero safety features (except handshake messages with ublox checksum).
